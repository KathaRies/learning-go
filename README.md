## Structure and order of my learning

### 1. Basics
Starting with the basics of go by following the tutorials provided on the [go website](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/). 
1. [Getting started](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started) (hello module)
2. [Modules](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module.html) , basic error handeling, testing, dependecies (greetings module)

### 2. Projects
The best way to learn is by doing. I am using the [coding challenges website](https://codingchallenges.fyi/) as they have a good description of the tasks so I mainly have to figure out the how and not the what. Learning more libraries, algorithms and features of go along the way.
   1. [wc](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc) commandline args, file reading, strings (wc/ccwc module)
